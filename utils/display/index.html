        <p>Computation is all around us. Since the breakthrough of modern integrated circuit technology, computation expanded
          into every aspect of everyday life. Transistor sizes down to 7 nanometer enable computation to hide behind user
          interfaces of all kinds, the internet creates a vast mesh of computational networks that connect and govern over half
          of the world's population, and companies chosen to bet on computation are now the leading top of economical power
          (Bridle, 2018).</p>
        <p>Computation is serving this platform of utter most power to its instructionist, the software. Software is the
          determining part of the computational equation. Its abstract symbol structures will guide the physical logic gates,
          which will inevitably result into a ripple of multiple electrical signals, deciding about the final output of the
          computational equation. Whether the final output is about displaying some trending tweets or whether it is consulting
          a judge deciding about someone's prison sentence; software is part of the equation and it is not only part of it, but
          it constitutes most of it. Through the computational platform software has the essential scale and the necessary
          flexible physical structure to be embedded into everyday life. Instead of just being part of it, being the layer on
          top or down under of the physical world, it has proven itself to be the interwoven medium used to build the systems of
          the information age of today. Its existence became essential to the western modern life.
          While computation (from now on as software and physical computation intertwined) decided more and more about human
          life, showing its increasing imprint in socio-political implications and with progress in the area of Artificial
          Intelligence, it gained increasing attention from sociologists and media theorists reflecting on the state of software
          in our societies. With the breakthrough of machine learning and deep neural networks and their immediate wide usage
          one particular phenomenon was recently acknowledged more frequently:</p>
        <p>Biased algorithms describe the appearance of discrimination and the reinforcement of prejudice connected to identity
          constructs like race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender or culture in computational systems. The concept of algorithmic
          bias rose in popularity because of recent incidents of heavily biased machine learning algorithms (Lipton, 2016).</p>
        <p>As we will see throughout the following articles, the idea is that the problem of algorithmic bias is a more complex
          one that shouldn't be simplified and limited to the discourse of machine learning. Although machine learning brings
          its new technical concepts with it, which shouldnâ€™t be disregarded in the analysis of bias, it is important to note
          that algorithmic bias is rooted in software per se, not machine learning. Algorithmic bias is a fundamental software
          problem. In recent conversations machine learning served as a catalyst and opaque layer which enforced the bias and
          distracted most research away from the actual underlying flaws of software development.
          To understand the implications of bias in machine learning it is important to first look at the foundation of bias in
          traditional software.</p>
